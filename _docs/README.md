# Project 5 | Specifications

    - [x] 1. Word Scramble: Introduction
    - [x] 2. Introducing List, your best friend
    - [x] 3. Loading resources from your app bundle
    - [x] 4. Working with strings

    - [x] 1. Adding to a list of words
    - [x] 2. Running code when our app launches
    - [x] 3. Validating words with UITextChecker


    
- Part 3 | Challenge: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/31
    - [ ] 1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
            - WIP
    - [x] 2. Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
        - Note:
            - I already implemented this at commit **92895ca** ... whoa, I was curious enough (and annoyed that I couldn't manually get a new word) that I was already already :3
    - [x] 3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the playerâ€™s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
